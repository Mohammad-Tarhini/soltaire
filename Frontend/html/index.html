            <h1 class="title" id="howtoplay">How To Play </h1>
            <p>Solitaire is played with a standard 52-card deck. The game begins with seven piles of cards, where only the top card of each pile is face-up. The goal is to build up four foundation piles, one for each suit, starting from Ace and ending with King. You can move cards between piles following alternating colors and descending order. When no more moves are available, draw new cards from the stockpile and continue until all cards are sorted.</p>
             <h1 class="title" id="gamerules">Game Rules </h1>
             <p>The rules of Solitaire are simple yet strategic. You can move one card or a sequence of properly ordered cards between tableau piles. Only Kings can be moved to empty spaces. The foundation piles must start with an Ace and build up by suit. The game ends when all cards are successfully placed on the foundation piles—or when no further moves are possible.</p>
            <h1 class="title" id="historyofsolitaire">History of solitaire </h1>
            <p>Solitaire’s origins date back to the late 18th century in Europe, where it was initially a game of patience and focus. It gained worldwide popularity when Microsoft introduced it as a built-in game on Windows in the 1990s. Since then, Solitaire has remained a timeless classic, loved by millions of players around the globe. </p>
